A key component of a CPU chip in a computer is an *arithmetic logic unit* (ALU) that performs arithmetic and bitwise logic operations on bits and larger groups of binary digits (*nibbles* comprised of 4 bits, *bytes* comprised of 8 bits, and *words* comprised of multiple bytes).  The ALU is built from simple gates that implement desired operations via truth table representations.
